            <p>InVision Community,</p>
            <p>Today I am writing to share that after careful consideration we have made the difficult decision to discontinue our design collaboration services. This decision comes as part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our product offerings and focus on our core strengths in the evolving design landscape.</p>
            <h2>What This Means for Our Users</h2>
            <p>Effective immediately, we will begin the process of winding down our collaboration tools. We understand that many of you have integrated these tools deeply into your workflows, and we want to ensure a smooth transition for all our users.</p>
            <p>Here's what you need to know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All existing projects will remain accessible for the next 6 months.</li>
                <li>We will not be accepting new sign-ups for our collaboration services.</li>
                <li>Our support team will be available to assist with any questions or concerns during this transition period.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>
            <p>While this marks the end of an era for InVision's collaboration tools, it also represents a new beginning. We are doubling down on our commitment to providing cutting-edge design solutions that meet the evolving needs of designers and teams worldwide.</p>
            <p>We want to express our deepest gratitude to all of our users who have been part of this journey. Your feedback, support, and creativity have been instrumental in shaping our products and our company.</p>
            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>As we move forward, we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We are investing heavily in new technologies and partnerships that we believe will revolutionize the design industry once again.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your understanding and continued support. We look forward to serving you in new and innovative ways in the future.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,<br>The InVision Team</p>
